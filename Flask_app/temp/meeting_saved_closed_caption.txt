Yes.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:12:40
Nice. I think maybe Hannah can go through. I think she meet some agendas for this meeting.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:12:54
In the meantime, every has everyone seen the flow diagram yet? I think.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:12:57
Yes.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:13:02
Yeah, maybe we can go through everyone and see what thoughts you all have. Any features you would like to add or any.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:13:07
Yeah.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:13:11
Maybe we can share screen someone.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:13:14
Go and share my screen.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:13:20
And you see the screen.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:13:23
Yes.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:13:24
Yes.

[Ben_CH] 22:13:24
Yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:13:30
But you can someone else share. So that I can watch.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:13:32
Oh yeah, sure, sure, sure. I do.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:13:34
You can do it.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:13:36

[Ryan_Edward] 22:13:42
Yeah, we can see.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:13:44
Okay, nice.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:13:47
So.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:13:47
We can view draft. Tree. I think cannot.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:13:53
I wrote that to consider.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:13:53
And

[Ryan_Edward] 22:13:58
And I, amuto, by the way. Yeah, you're speaking.

[Hannah Nga] 22:14:04
Oh shit. Oh, okay, I just sent it in the in the group chat. Agenda.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:14:11
Nice.

[Hannah Nga] 22:14:14
Okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:14:24
Yeah, so after the meeting and everyone send me, VITHOP, I I was thinking maybe after we are almost under, we make it public.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:14:29
Yes.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:14:37
Sounds good.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:14:41
Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:14:42
Okay, so. Okay, those stuff that

[Hannah Nga] 22:14:49
Awesome. Nicole, I, yeah, I agree with all those. I think you can add that in there. I think you can add that in there.

[Hannah Nga] 22:14:58
But for the automated follow-ups. I think it's very hard to show how it will work in like the video.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:15:11
Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah, I just added in a bunch of stuff.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:11
Or something. Yeah. I think it's just it's a cool feature to have but Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:20
Digital summaries Like for what?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:15:25
I don't know, like I was just thinking about like what we can do other than this.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:29
Oh, you're here.

[Ben_CH] 22:15:32
Yeah, your point number 2. It's the point number 2 is to send like, remind the email.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:15:32
I think. Sorry.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:15:39
Hmm. Or maybe like a follow up email for each participant with with with the things they need to do.

[Ben_CH] 22:15:39
O.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:51
Yeah, yes, yes, yes, that's why, okay, my idea is like the personalized to do this.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:58
It's basically like from the transcript you extract like for each person what has been allocated to them and then all the emails that are sent out like each person will have a unique section that emphasizes what they am into this, specifically.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:00
Okay, okay, okay.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:08
Hmm.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:20
10. Okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:16:22
Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:16:27
Yeah, I couldn't really think of anything else like any other features to it.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:32
I think quite a few already, but if we do the, and, and the.

[Hannah Nga] 22:16:41
Okay, I think the hardest part will be the sentimental There is quite, basic.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:16:42
Yeah.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:44
Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:16:48
That has been that before. So. A lot, a lot of resources for that.

[Ben_CH] 22:16:50
One

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:51
Language transition there should be a lot of code online for the I'm like, okay.

[Ben_CH] 22:16:58
Good day.

[Hannah Nga] 22:16:59
Okay, then.

[Hannah Nga] 22:17:03
Okay, then if we can agree on the features. Then we can move on to the bookload distribution.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:17:11
Hmm.

[Hannah Nga] 22:17:11
So, okay, yeah.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:17:11
Hey, Dad, chat bot is it Yeah, it's not. It's just a 2, 2.

[Hannah Nga] 22:17:16
No. No.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:17:21
UP.

[Hannah Nga] 22:17:23
Yes.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:17:24
Yes. So what we envision is like after the meeting. We have a bunch of files, or whatever, we send, we throw it in or the transcript, we throw in.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:17:35
Hmm.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:17:35
Then your own self journey, the host meeting meets and send to everyone.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:17:40
So essentially, post meeting so you don't need to take minutes during the meeting. Yeah, You don't know.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:17:40
Oh.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:17:49
Will, will that be? Okay, whenever there'd be some, there'll be some, of the meeting through the.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:17:57
Oh.

[Hannah Nga] 22:17:59
Yes.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:18:00
Yes. Yes.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:18:02
Okay, cause I saw one at this. Yeah, you can converse. With the, to us like what the.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:18:04
So.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:18:12
Key. Summaries or action numbers for this meeting or for the meeting last week. Oh, last week.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:18:20
Yeah. So, Yeah, yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:18:21
Yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:18:24
Yeah, I was checking with the profile. He said like, For the, the documents that you only need is, this current meeting.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:18:33
We don't need to have like previous meeting.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:18:36
Okay. Okay. Okay, Simpler, yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:18:40
So, yeah.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:18:41
Yeah. Okay, and you can do that features then. Yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:18:48
I mean, if you want, we can also extend our functionality to be a chat bot also.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:18:58
Yeah, I can see the.

[Ben_CH] 22:18:59
I think. Yeah.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:19:00
Yes, I'm sorry to cut in them. It's like an automated follow-up is possible to just each other participant had their own database.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:19:08
With the line and the task. Let me just keep depending today, right?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:19:16
But we need the users to continuously. See whether they have complete.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:19:24
Yeah. Yes.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:19:25
Right? Or we just blindly send email. I mean we could do that.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:19:34
Just, for, one, the, the, the, features.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:19:40
Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:19:43
I don't think we, the reminders are spring button.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:19:49
Actually, when I said the meeting thing to the pro, I think you satisfied with the simple bit. So if we add like the translation, the Sentiment and I feel like that's already like

[Ryan_Edward] 22:20:05
Okay. Yes.

[Hannah Nga] 22:20:05
Gwenova

[Ryan_Edward] 22:20:13
But.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:20:13
What's the sentiment and then he's for sorry.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:20:13
Oh.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:20:16
So it's to, wait, currently by wrong, it's just to order the different actionable based on the most original on top.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:20:25
Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:20:25
Priority allocation.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:20:27
Okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:20:31
No, for the, sentiment analysis is within one user, right?

[Hannah Nga] 22:20:37
That one doesn't have to be decided right now.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:20:41
Oh, okay, yes.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:20:46
So,

[Hannah Nga] 22:20:48
Does anyone have questions about the? Pipeline.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:20:56
No, everything looks good.

[Hannah Nga] 22:20:58
Okay, we just need to in all of the features. That you just talked about first and then go submit the this weekend.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:21:05
So.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:21:05
Yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:21:08
Oh, this is correct, right? The confirm features. Are we please?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:21:09
Hmm.

[Ben_CH] 22:21:11
Hmm.

[Hannah Nga] 22:21:16
The personalized action plan we want to include it.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:21:19
Yes, Yeah, so how do you, how do I do it?

[Hannah Nga] 22:21:22
Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:21:33
Do I?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:21:35
You wanted to do it like

[Ryan_Edward] 22:21:39
Independent task or like

[Ryan_Edward] 22:21:43
After one task, then you move another task.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:21:50
By the output from the personalized to the list, then we show it into the I'll just see the prioritization.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:21:58
You know, or we treated. Okay.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:22:02
Hmm. Oh.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:22:07
You mean like speak up.

[Hannah Nga] 22:22:08
That's a good question. Oh, okay, okay, I know I know. Okay, one way we can do it is like in one section of the upward there's a overview of All the tasks and then we can have another prompt like 1 one more problem that ask the ln to extract the the task.

[Hannah Nga] 22:22:37
And then they just edit through the output. And then for that one.

[Hannah Nga] 22:22:48
Another query to do the priority application. Yeah. Okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:22:52
We're all sorry, can you? You, you know, VP, I'm trying to do it.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:22:53
Are they lost?

[Hannah Nga] 22:22:58
Oh

[Ryan_Edward] 22:22:58
So after I generate the minutes then we split 2 users. Is it?

[Hannah Nga] 22:23:05
But what do you mean by January minutes?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:23:08
Right.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:23:11
Connie, I just say like, provide a summary of the within minutes. Then what other action of those?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:23:17
Of the meeting. I just contact both as the meeting meetings. Yeah, but if you want, we can bring this down even more.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:23:26
So we can. But you don't do individual steps. Right. Step one.

[Hannah Nga] 22:23:30
Yeah, that's why I would do.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:23:32
Okay, so

[Ryan_Edward] 22:23:38
Oh, in one problem or in different

[Hannah Nga] 22:23:43
Devon can be chain of thought.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:23:45
Oh, chain off.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:23:48
In normal. Bye.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:23:51
Okay. So one.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:23:56
Let me just.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:24:00
Once again, adding multiple, but generate.

[Hannah Nga] 22:24:04
Okay, I think we I know I know Sentiment analysis would come right at the end.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:24:10
Yes, correct. Channel.

[Hannah Nga] 22:24:14
Yeah. So, okay, we don't have to decide exactly how it will work. In court yet.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:24:22
Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:24:23
Cause that one we can. Like traw in aerodrome breeze. Right now we can just like vaguely draw it out.

[Hannah Nga] 22:24:30
So if you know what accounts first then then security.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:24:34
Okay, so general.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:24:38
Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:24:43
Then the person personalized

[Ryan_Edward] 22:24:45
Yeah.

[Ben_CH] 22:25:03
With the each user run sentiment and SS to determine priority.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:25:09
Yes, I guess.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:25:13
In third

[Hannah Nga] 22:25:13
It's just like 4. All of the the action of both and the task list. You just input that again and then ask it to.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:25:25
Right

[Hannah Nga] 22:25:26
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:25:34
Something like that. Thank you.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:25:44
Once this wedding.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:25:48
That's how I still do this.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:26:05
And actionable.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:26:14
And also the language translation will be from the start until end, right? Denver.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:26:21
Yeah, I think.

[Hannah Nga] 22:26:21
No, language translation will be right in. Like we have the output in English and then if the person doesn't want English, then we just translate the whole thing.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:26:27
Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:26:32
So is much simpler that way.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:26:36
That means

[Ryan_Edward] 22:26:37
After the look flow of all these then

[Ryan_Edward] 22:26:42
Awesome. There you just go to this bar.

[Hannah Nga] 22:26:42
And then translate it to Transluor.

[Hannah Nga] 22:26:47
Because if not, then we will need separate problems for everything, like in different languages. There's a lot more work.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:26:52
Hmm.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:26:54
Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:26:55
And what API calls.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:26:57
I mean.

[Hannah Nga] 22:27:01
Yeah, but is for the, you must be realistic

[Ryan_Edward] 22:27:11
Thank you.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:27:36
Something like that. All right.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:27:42
Or the multiple language experience.

[Hannah Nga] 22:27:54
Yeah

[Hannah Nga] 22:27:58
Yeah, that's okay, that's okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:28:08
I was thinking I'll just

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:28:09
What's the arrows at the bottom for? Oh.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:28:12
I just created 2.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:28:15
Copy and face, you know.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:28:15
Okay, 3 thing. Yes, based upon them. Yeah. Oh sorry, I remove.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:28:20
Okay.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:28:22
I remove.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:28:24
I was thinking just.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:28:28
Oh, okay, okay.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:28:53
The language translation.

[Hannah Nga] 22:28:53
Okay, that is basically, yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:28:55
Yeah.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:28:56
It's only It's only for meeting minutes.

[Hannah Nga] 22:29:01
Knows for everything. That's why we're doing it at the end.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:29:02
So everything.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:29:07
How to do everything.

[Hannah Nga] 22:29:10
Cause you have the, you basically have. The output that you want is just that is in English. So we just.

[Hannah Nga] 22:29:17
Ask the LM translate this entire thing into Spanish. Chinese, yeah. Instead of having it.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:29:21
Chinese. No.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:29:23
Hmm. Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:29:28
Having our problems in Chinese. Or Like I do another step to make sure that the responses are in Chinese every step.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:29:36
Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:29:40
That's too much for.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:29:40
Hmm, okay, yeah, I think they will. No, the only thing is maybe in my head token, the the input a lot.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:29:48
Everything together but we can try because yeah you.

[Hannah Nga] 22:29:52
No, like you will, it won't hit the token in me because This would be like a separate API call.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:29:56
Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:30:00
And it would and the input would The input number of tokens would be the almost the same as the the outputs of the the previous few calls.

[Hannah Nga] 22:30:16
For for one person for Emerson.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:30:23
Okay, We do ship part of things.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:30:29
Yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:30:32
Yeah, if the thing is okay, then we can. Release that.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:30:35
Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:30:39
Are there any more questions?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:30:45
So we sticking to the just send in Laura, no need to do the checkbook.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:30:56
Yeah, I think it's fine.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:30:57
Okay, Ken.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:31:14
Nothing.

[Hannah Nga] 22:31:25
Okay, can we do the, bottle distribution now?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:31:29
Hmm.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:31:30
Well, that's

[Ryan_Edward] 22:31:49
And

[Ryan_Edward] 22:32:02
Yeah, so there are a few rules that, Hannah has proposed. So.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:32:07
Oh, there's from engineers. Then, deploying the application on We And front end, and the end.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:32:20
Is there anything that, let me stop?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:32:25
And.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:32:26
I don't think so. I think it's fine, but maybe we want to decide on like the distribution of everything.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:32:34
Yeah, so how many? How many packs for each?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:32:34
Nice.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:32:39
Yeah.

[Ben_CH] 22:32:40
We need to, might take up. I don't know.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:32:49
Yeah. Like the sentiment analysis, all these is like kind of separate. From yeah maybe we can get 2 people or even 3.

[Ben_CH] 22:32:50
I think back.

[Ben_CH] 22:32:57
Yeah, it's another ticket engineering.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:33:06
I mean, it makes sense for we building multiple rules also.

[Hannah Nga] 22:33:08
Yeah, that's okay too. Because I think the deployment stuff is just a one-time thing, right?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:33:10
Hmm.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:33:15
Hmm.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:33:15
Yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:33:20
I don't mind taking multiple schools. I want to pasta finish this then can do the buttons.

[Hannah Nga] 22:33:25
Yeah, me too. I think. I can contribute on most of the from engineering because I have experience in like the summarization for.

[Hannah Nga] 22:33:37
For this time off. I mean for for this use case.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:33:42
Okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:33:45
Okay, that's how we've still deployed. But. I tried for DSA 3 1 1.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:33:45
Well.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:33:52
I managed to doctorize my app. And upload. We, EC 2 instance, but I couldn't.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:33:59
Connect with IP address of the local host.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:34:03
So I So, Sorry, that was it.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:34:04
One

[Ryan_Edward] 22:34:11
Yeah. Does anyone want to do funding?

[Eugene_YJ] 22:34:17
Let me Yeah.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:34:19
I don't mind but I think I need to do it somewhere else or so like maybe I do both front end plus back in.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:34:19
Oh.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:34:27
No.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:34:30
Not really, but my front end experience was me like the very basic one like So, I think.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:34:39
Can I don't. I want try to do something different, but if no one else can do finance, I'll do that.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:34:39
You know.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:34:39
Alright.

[Ben_CH] 22:34:48
What does that?

[Eugene_YJ] 22:34:51
Make sure you have to do the whole.

[Ben_CH] 22:34:54
Wow.

[Hannah Nga] 22:34:56
That one we, we still don't really know because, when I I think we're not that good at front end, so I think we can just do the minimum.

[Hannah Nga] 22:35:07
Like. Oh website where you just input the code file, I mean, the transcript. Audio files and then or the emails and language preferences.

[Eugene_YJ] 22:35:07
It was just.

[Hannah Nga] 22:35:19
You just hit a button and then.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:35:23
Oh, okay, then the one I think can maybe like something like a dash app or something like super simple one.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:35:29
Yeah, simple candy.

[Hannah Nga] 22:35:30
Yeah, it can it can be simple as long as it looks good enough that someone that that doesn't know how it works will be impressed.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:35:30
Yeah.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:35:39
Okay, but my friend, IS, like basic of the basic, like, a website, but it's functional.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:35:45
It's okay. Thank you. I think the

[Ben_CH] 22:35:47

[Hannah Nga] 22:47:09
Okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:47:14
Yeah, she called once more thing for the Bye. Do you want to like standardize the colors or anything?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:47:23
Like Papo is phone.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:47:24
I didn't understand. Yeah, what the blue and the green men.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:47:30
So I thought like Green will be like finalized output by I don't know where it's open open for

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:47:34
Oh, okay. Then maybe we just write on in the legend that is finalized output.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:47:43
Yeah, I'm not sure that could be. Nice, fork. So then that diamond is diamond is when there's a logic branch.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:47:55
Hmm.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:47:57
But the blue and then the red API and then the We do problem there, I still don't want to color them.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:48:03
Hmm.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:48:06
If anyone got suggestions of That was just make all the So, Yeah, for this for the preliminary outputs what colors should they be?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:48:08
I think can just add the green one first because the one is

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:48:13
Alright.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:48:24
Hmm. And you what? Oh.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:48:33
As in the preliminary apple is different from the restor is a new category, right? Maybe put it or something.

Yeah. Okay, I will put it as which one are you referring to?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:48:43
Hmm.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:48:56
The generated meeting, in language preference one shouldn't be a finalized output hall.

[Hannah Nga] 22:49:05
But why? Why not?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:49:07
Right, the multiple 3 green ones like because like the user is not receiving that right away it is Yeah, okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:49:16
They are there. So if they

[Hannah Nga] 22:49:17

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:49:33
Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:49:38
Oh, which part?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:49:39
How can we save this and.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:49:45
I think he doesn't really care. Our image should be fine. He says send by email, huh?

[Hannah Nga] 22:49:49
Guy Mish.

[Hannah Nga] 22:49:52

[Ryan_Edward] 22:50:38
So I'm in what we have.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:50:42
I think in some meet what we have.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:50:44
Okay.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:50:49
Yup, good.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:50:57
And now we want to revert some of the things.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:51:01
I know you'll see you want it to ID.

[Hannah Nga] 22:51:07
I think this is okay already.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:51:10
Okay.

[Hannah Nga] 22:51:14
Oh, on the right side, the generate the meeting minutes. Are we gonna keep, okay, so on on the right side, the generate the meeting minutes.

[Hannah Nga] 22:51:23
Are we gonna keep it?

[Hannah Nga] 22:51:25
It is good now.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:51:43
Yeah, editing.

[Hannah Nga] 22:51:59
Okay, so anything else?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:52:02
You can go one round.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:52:05
And

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:52:05
Oh, sorry, yeah, let me just check the for the output for the front end. So the input like I will have 3 sections, one for file input, which is audio, PPD or PDF.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:52:16
Then after that, like text input, which is select the language and email, then I will output the output section will be meeting minute summary.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:52:25
Like your personal.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:52:28
All action and all action, Then meeting minute summary or actionable and then Would there be like a check whether they want to?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:52:40
1, 2, 2, sentiment analysis, or is it like compulsory? Like you know I mean I when I press run Like does everything come out?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:52:45
Yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:52:49
Yeah, I was thinking like for What users will see will be the green portions. So user first, So as a user, he will he will, he will be on a home page, which can upload files.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:52:55
Okay. Okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:53:04
And then he must he must click a few languages and input all the users email. After he submit, he will load then the next page will just show all the generated meeting.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:53:04
Thanks.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:53:08
Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:53:14
Then after that for each one they can choose to accept. Then. After that, that if the accept then we can just save and send to.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:53:18
Okay

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:53:21
Okay.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:53:26
Okay, can then if okay yes

[Ryan_Edward] 22:53:27
Does that make sense?

[Jeremy_PH] 22:53:32
Only the ID is edit wire.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:53:36
Manual edit right or like the need to do it again

[Ryan_Edward] 22:53:40
Yeah, I left. East, honest efforts I was thinking of just He was a, I thought to extend the functionality to ask the RM to regenerate.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:53:53
Do you want to include that or you want to?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:53:57
So, this talk.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:54:01
Is to meet generator to do this.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:54:03
Regenerate the whole meeting meeting

[Ryan_Edward] 22:54:09
Oh, maybe we can, we can have the user to indicate which portion. Do you want to edit?

[Ryan_Edward] 22:54:16
They want the R to regenerate. But that would be a bit more work I guess.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:54:37
I think that we can decide a bit later, right? We just try out first.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:54:44
Hmm. Yeah. The The actual program can deviate a bit from the

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:54:45
Oh

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:54:49
Okay. Okay, thanks.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:54:52
The proposed plan. Yeah.

[Ben_CH] 22:54:52
Okay.

[Jeremy_PH] 22:54:54
Okay.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:54:58
Okay. Oh

[Ryan_Edward] 22:54:59
When I asked you was in the context of adding stuff.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:55:09
Okay.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:55:14
Okay. Yeah.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:55:27
I okay if I make the create new collection and upload user files to

[Ryan_Edward] 22:55:35
This pink color then the legend will just be

[Ryan_Edward] 22:55:41
H to all AI API calls.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:55:44
Hmm.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:55:49
Thank you.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:55:59
