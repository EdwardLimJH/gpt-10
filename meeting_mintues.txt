Okay, so. Okay, those stuff that

[Hannah Nga] 22:14:49
Awesome. Nicole, I, yeah, I agree with all those. I think you can add that in there. I think you can add that in there.

[Hannah Nga] 22:14:58
But for the automated follow-ups. I think it's very hard to show how it will work in like the video.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:15:11
Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah, I just added in a bunch of stuff.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:11
Or something. Yeah. I think it's just it's a cool feature to have but Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:20
Digital summaries Like for what?

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:15:25
I don't know, like I was just thinking about like what we can do other than this.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:29
Oh, you're here.

[Ben_CH] 22:15:32
Yeah, your point number 2. It's the point number 2 is to send like, remind the email.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:15:32
I think. Sorry.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:15:39
Hmm. Or maybe like a follow up email for each participant with with with the things they need to do.

[Ben_CH] 22:15:39
O.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:51
Yeah, yes, yes, yes, that's why, okay, my idea is like the personalized to do this.

[Hannah Nga] 22:15:58
It's basically like from the transcript you extract like for each person what has been allocated to them and then all the emails that are sent out like each person will have a unique section that emphasizes what they am into this, specifically.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:00
Okay, okay, okay.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:08
Hmm.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:20
10. Okay.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:16:22
Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:16:27
Yeah, I couldn't really think of anything else like any other features to it.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:32
I think quite a few already, but if we do the, and, and the.

[Hannah Nga] 22:16:41
Okay, I think the hardest part will be the sentimental There is quite, basic.

[Ryan_Edward] 22:16:42
Yeah.

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:44
Yeah.

[Hannah Nga] 22:16:48
That has been that before. So. A lot, a lot of resources for that.

[Ben_CH] 22:16:50
One

[Chan Yi Ru Micole] 22:16:51
Language transition there should be a lot of code online for the I'm like, okay.

[Ben_CH] 22:16:58
Good day.

[Hannah Nga] 22:16:59
